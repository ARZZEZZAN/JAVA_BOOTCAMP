# Chapter I
### Preamble
The client/server interaction is the backbone of up-to-date systems. Server performs a large volume of business logic and information storage. As a result, the client application load is significantly reduced.

Dividing the logic into server and client components enables to flexibly build a general system architecture if server and client implementations are maximally independent.

Client and server communicate via numerous protocols described in OSI network model as different layers:

Layer |	Example
---|---
7.<font> Application |	HTTP
6.<font> Representation |	ASCII
5.<font> Session |	RPC
4.<font> Transport |	TCP, UDP
3.<font> Network |	IPv4
2.<font> Channel |	Ethernet, DSL
1.<font> Physical |	USB, "twisted pair"

# Chapter II
### General Rules
- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations about how to prepare your solution.
- Now there is only one Java version for you, 1.8. Make sure that compiler and interpreter of this version are installed on your machine.
- You can use IDE to write and debug the source code.
- The code is read more often than written. Read carefully the [document](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf) where code formatting rules are given. When performing each task, make sure you follow the generally accepted [Oracle standards](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html).

- Comments are not allowed in the source code of your solution. They make it difficult to read the code.
- Pay attention to the permissions of your files and directories.
- To be assessed, your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your bootcamp mates.
- You should not leave in your "src" directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your .gitignore to avoid accidents.
- When you need to get precise output in your programs, it is forbidden to display a precalculated output instead of performing the exercise correctly.
- Have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. And one more thing. There's an answer to any question you may have on Stackoverflow. Learn how to ask questions correctly.
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- Use System.out for output.
- And may the Force be with you!
- Never leave that till tomorrow which you can do today ;)

# Chapter III
### Exercise 00 – Registration

Exercise 00: Registration ||
---|---
Turn-in directory	| ex00
Files to turn-in |	Chat-folder

Before you start creating a full-scale, multi-user chat, you need to implement core functionality and build the foundational architecture of the system.

Now you need to create two applications: socket-server and socket-client. Server shall support connecting a single client and be made as a separate Maven project. Server JAR file is launched as follows:
```
$ java -jar target/socket-server.jar --port=8081
```

Client is also a separate project:
```
$ java -jar target/socket-client.jar --server-port=8081
```

In this task, you need to implement the registration functionality. Example of the client operation:
```
Hello from Server!
> signUp
Enter username:
> Marsel
Enter password:
> qwerty007
Successful!
```

Connection must be closed after Successful! message appears.

To ensure secure storage of passwords, use a hashing mechanism with PasswordEncoder and BCryptPasswordEncoder (see Spring Security components). Bin for this component shall be described in a class of SocketsApplicationConfig configuration and used in UsersService.

Key client/server interaction logic and the use of UsersService via Spring Context shall be implemented in Server class.

**Additional requirements**:
- Use a single DataSource—HikariCP
- Repository operation shall be implemented via JdbcTemplate
- Services, repositories, utility classes shall be context bins.

Server application architecture (client application is at the developer's discretion):

- Char
    - SocketServer
        - src
            - main
                - java
                    - edu.school21.sockets
                        - server
                            -	Server
                        - models
                            -	User
                        - services
                            - UsersService
                            - UsersServiceImpl
                        - repositories
                            - CrudRepository
                            - UsersRepository
                            - UsersRepositoryImpl
                        - app
                            - Main
                        - config
                            - SocketsApplicationConfig
                - resources
                    - db.properties
        - pom.xml

# Chapter IV
### Exercise 01 – Messaging

Exercise 01: Messaging ||
---|---
Turn-in directory |	ex01
Files to turn-in |	Chat-folder

Once you have implemented the application backbone, you should provide multi-user message exchange.

You need to modify the application so that it supports the following chat user life cycle:
1. Registration
2. Sign in (if no user is detected, close a connection)
3. Sending messages (each user connected to the server must receive a message)
4. Logout

Example of the application operation on the client side:
```
Hello from Server!
> signIn
Enter username:
> Marsel
Enter password:
> qwerty007
Start messaging
> Hello!
Marsel: Hello!
NotMarsel: Bye!
> Exit
You have left the chat.
```
Each message shall be saved in the database and contain the following information:
- Sender
- Message text
- Sending time

**Note**:
- For comprehensive testing, several jar files of the client application shall be run.

# Chapter V
### Exercise 02 – Rooms

Exercise 02: Rooms ||
---|---
Turn-in directory |	ex02
Files to turn-in |	Chat-folder

To make our application fully-featured, let's add the concept of "chatrooms" to it. Each chatroom can have a certain set of users. The chatroom contains a set of messages from participating users.

Each user can:
1.	Create a chatroom
2.	Choose a chatroom
3.	Send a message to a chatroom
4.	Leave a chatroom

When the user re-enters the application, 30 last messages shall be displayed in the room the user visited previously.

Example of the application operation on the client side:
```
Hello from Server!
1. signIn
2. SignUp
3. Exit
> 1
Enter username:
> Marsel
Enter password:
> qwerty007
1.	Create room
2.	Choose room
3.	Exit
> 2
Rooms:
1. First Room
2. SimpleRoom
3. JavaRoom
4. Exit
> 3
Java Room ---
JavaMan: Hello!
> Hello!
Marsel: Hello!
> Exit
You have left the chat.
```

Using JSON format for message exchange will be a special task for you. In this way, each user command or message must be transferred to the server (and received from the server) in the form of a JSON line.

For example, a command for sending a message may look as follows (specific contents of messages are at the discretion of a developer):
```JSON
{
  "message" : "Hello!",
  "fromId" : 4,
  "roomId": 10
}
```
